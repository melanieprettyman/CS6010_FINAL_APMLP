Labyrinth of Learning; Teacher Throwdown


Project Description
Labyrinth of Learning; Teacher Throwdown is a 2D video game where two players control characters in a maze, collecting balls to earn points. The goal is to be the first player to reach 6 points. Players can also gain or lose points by colliding with each other based on their point differentials.


Technologies Used
C++ programming language
SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) for 2D graphics and window management


Challenges Faced
Implementing player movement and collision detection.
Creating an interactive maze environment.
Implementing the point system and collision-based point changes.
Ensuring smooth rendering and game logic.


How to Install and Run the Project
1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install CMake if you haven't already.
3. Build the project using CMake and Make.
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
Run the game


How to Use the Project
1. Player 1 controls: Use arrow keys to move.
Player 2 controls: Use WASD keys to move.
2. Collect balls to earn points.
3. Engage in collisions with the opposing player to earn or deduct points according to the point difference. For instance, if player 'A' surpasses player 'B' in points and subsequently collides with 'B', player 'A' accumulates an additional two points, while 'B' is reset to the center of the maze and loses one point.
4. Be the first player to reach 6 points to win the game.
